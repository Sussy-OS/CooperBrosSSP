An SSP is a survival multiplayer (SMP) but has additions.

One of the main additions is being able to create your own
private world, with custom settings.

What else do you need?

### Our story

Hello, there! I'm James, the creator of the server.
I have for many years dreamed of being able to hang
out with my friends while being stuck at home, and 
then I found out how- a minecraft server! Currently,
the server is whitelisted to only friends, but if you ask
nicely, I might add you! Website: https://james.just-logged-your-ip.lol/ and https://jamespi.carrd.co
