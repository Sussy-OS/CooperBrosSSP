I logged onto the Cooper Bros SSP (after finishing my homework).
 My goal was to create a simple unique button. I used scoreboard commands to subtract 1 
off of the Player Counter, and removed the tag the players get for the game. 
Finally, I tp the players back to the hub. After some testing, it works perfectly!
I also added a small Easter Egg into the game, who will find it first?
